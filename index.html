                <p>
                    To support Georgia Tech's goal to provide a more flexible and individualized degree program for students,
                    we propose implementing an intelligent registration-aid system. This system will cluster similar students
                    based on their strengths, interests, and career paths in order to provide a personalized review of potential
                    courses and professors. Information concerning course difficulty, interest of each course to students, and
                    usefulness of courses to intended career paths will be analyzed and presented to students based on the
                    statistics for past students of the same group. This process will empower students to effectively and
                    confidently choose courses and build their own degree.

                    The registration process is not an integrated experience. When students want to compare professors, they might
                    use Rate My Professors. For a more general course evaluation, they may turn to Course Critique. Additionally,
                    students may solicit the advice of friends that, to the best of their knowledge, have relevant experience. Students
                    waste time painstakingly integrating information from these disparate sources. Furthermore, when students find that
                    the courses they selected do not meet their expectations, they may be forced to drop courses, postpone graduation,
                    or worse. Students are familiar with the experience of being recommended some course because it is an "easy A,"
                    "very engaging," or "pertinent to my major," but after registering for said course, their experience is starkly
                    different from their expectations.

                    These expectations so frequently diverge from reality because many different kinds of students exist. Students
                    have different strengths and weaknesses, and they often forget this fact when giving opinions about courses to other
                    students. Differences in student experiences span majors, age groups, interests, and a myriad of other possible variables.
                    Discussion among students regarding class selection is carried out in ignorance of these differences. There is no way
                    for a student to know if the advice they give or receive about class expectations is applicable.

                    There exists no single resource with which students might acquire the necessary information to select classes that
                    are interesting, manageable, and applicable to the students' individual goals. Georgia Tech wishes to provide its students
                    with a "flexible and individualized degree program," but difficulties in registration make it challenging for students
                    to plan a path to graduation through courses that they need, want, and can manage. Georgia Tech already collects some
                    relevant information regarding student reactions to classes in the form of the CIOS process but this information is not
                    available to students. Students need a way to make confident decisions during registration with information relevant to them.
